executes commands, and displays the results. It processes command chaining using
operators like `&&`, `||`, and `;`. The shell also supports basic built-in
commands such as `exit`, `cd`, and `help`.

The shell allows users to interact with the system by typing commands, with
support for handling environment variables and executing commands in the context
of the user's current environment.
